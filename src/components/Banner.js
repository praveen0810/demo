    <p>When trying to write this end-of-the-year post, I realised my words were not enough to describe the COVID-19 pandemic or its impact. So I borrowed an idea from science journalist Kai Kupferschmidt, who asked his twitter followers which were the “pandemic quotes” they most remembered.
ie12 months. But I have selected 10 statements that struck me- for better or for worse- and which may help illustrate how the pandemic has unfolded and what may await us next.
